Title: A Newly Developed R Package: K-means Trend Analysis and Visualization
Version: 0.0.1

Maintainer: Fei Liang <tplate@acm.org>
Description: KmeansTrendAnalyzer is used to analyze the relative abundance trends of genes/proteins/metabolites in different groups. It involves standardizing the average relative abundance of genes/proteins/metabolites in each group, followed by K-means clustering analysis. After trend analysis, further gene/protein/metabolite functional analysis can be performed on the identified clusters, such as GO, KEGG enrichment analysis, etc., until the exploration of genes of interest is achieved.
